# CS370

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The given code included game setup code with two seperate files GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py. I provided the code that makes up the actual learning reinforcment algorithm as well as the code that achieves the pathfinding solution through loops that use keras and tensorflow. 

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists have the ability to develop smart software systems that help people either automate tasks or sort, store, and/or make sense of large sets of data. 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

The best way to approach any problem as a computer scientist in my opinion is to do as much research as possible before actually building any types of system that would solve any problems. Using the tools and knowlede of the whole industry is the best tool that we have as computer scientists.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

I think the biggest ethical responsibility as a computer scientist especially when it comes to artificial intelligence is bias. Bias can be added into a system even without malicious intentions.
